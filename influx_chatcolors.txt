#NOTE: The palette requires a chat processor

Some information about the palette:
The kernel uses a dynamic palette: 'addons/sourcemod/configs/influx_palette.ini'

In the config, the left column contains a color abbreviation that you can use to color your posts.
The right column stores colors in hexadecimal (HEX html) or character representation.
For example:
    - HEX: #FFFFFF
    - Character: 1 (special character: SOH)

CS:GO doesn't support hex colors, so the right column in the config cannot be changed

NOTE:
The maximum size for a color abbreviation, in the left column is limited to 15 single-byte characters
